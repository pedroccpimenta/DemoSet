# DemoSet

## Welcome!

Hi! Welcome here!
Hope this can be useful to you.
I decided to create this github repository since a tool I had setup for my personal use had proven useful for other people.

## Basic concept and pros

During my experience as Tango / Milonga DJ, I felt that I need something as the following 'player':
![logos/milongadj2.png]

the main pros of this 'console' against other media players are:

- a 'full' view of the 'lists' available
- a clear, visible, descriptive title for each 'list', coloured accordingly the 'type of music'
- the possibility to 'open' / 'close' every list
- some other 'features' / possibilities, viz:
![logos/milongadj3.png]

-- to change the font of the text
-- to jump -10 / +10 secs in the music
-- to jump for the previous / next song
-- to play the songs in a random order (or through the sequence defined in the lists)
-- to repeat the song, the 'tanda' or the full set of the musics in the 'console'
-- to test if the 'playlist' is ok (by playing only the first 15 secs)

Please, play around with the 'console' available at [https://milongadj.onrender.com/](https://milongadj.onrender.com/) before the next sections!
